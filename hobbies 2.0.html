    <h2>My Top 3 Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <img
        src="Reading.jpg"
        style="height: 200px; width: 200px"
        alt="Reading"
      />
      <h3>Why do I enjoy reading?</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve always had a passion for reading, and it’s one of my favorite ways
        to escape into different worlds and perspectives. There’s something
        magical about immersing myself in a good book; it allows me to explore
        new ideas and experiences without leaving my space.
      </p>

      <li>Arts and Crafts</li>
      <img
        src="ac.jpg"
        style="height: 200px; width: 200px"
        alt="Arts and Crafts"
      />
      <h3>Why do I enjoy Arts and Crafts?</h3>
      <p>
        Arts and crafts also hold a special place in my heart. Crafting allows
        me to channel my creativity and produce something tangible. There’s a
        sense of satisfaction that comes from creating something with my own
        hands, whether it’s painting, knitting, or any other form of craft.
      </p>

      <li>True Crime</li>
      <img src="tc.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 200px" alt="True Crime" />
      <h3>Why do I enjoy True Crime?</h3>
      <p>
        True crime fascinates me because it delves into the complexities of
        human nature and the darker aspects of society. It’s like a puzzle that
        I enjoy piecing together, and each story offers a new perspective on
        real-life events.
